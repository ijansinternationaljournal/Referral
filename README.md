In recent years, AdHoc networks have been attracting much interest in both academic and industrial communities. International Journal on AdHoc Networking Systems is an open access peer-reviewed journal that serves as a forum to discuss on ongoing research and new contributions. The journal addresses both practical and theoretical research in the areas of ad hoc networks, sensor networks, mesh networks and vehicular networks. Its main focus is on all issues from link layer up to the application layer. The journal solicits original technical papers that were not previously published and are not currently under review for publication elsewhere.
