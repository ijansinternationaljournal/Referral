ISSN : 2249 - 0175 [Online] ; 2249 - 2682 [Print]

Scope & Topics

In recent years, AdHoc networks have been attracting much interest in both academic and industrial communities. International Journal on AdHoc Networking Systems is an open access peer-reviewed journal that serves as a forum to discuss on ongoing research and new contributions. The journal addresses both practical and theoretical research in the areas of ad hoc networks, sensor networks, mesh networks and vehicular networks. Its main focus is on all issues from link layer up to the application layer. The journal solicits original technical papers that were not previously published and are not currently under review for publication elsewhere.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to, the following

Wireless mesh networks and cognitive networks
Vehicular Networks and Protocols
Mobile Ad Hoc Networks
Sensor Networks
MAC layer design for Ad-Hoc Networks and WSNs
MAC Protocols (802.11, 802.15.4, UWB)
Multi-channel, Multi-radio and MIMO Technologies
Cross layer Design and Optimization
Wireless Local and Personal Area Networks
Home Networks
Ad Hoc Networks of Autonomous Intelligent Systems
Novel Architectures for Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks
